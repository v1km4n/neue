### neue
My crappy **HEAVILY** outdated discord bot that runs on prehistoric version of discord.js (v12).
It mostly contains personal related commands and stuff, the only thing that *I guess* can be useful for others is [ETF2L](https://etf2l.org/)/[UGC](https://www.ugcleague.com/)/[RGL](https://rgl.gg/) parser. 

### Installation
Friendly reminder to myself in case I need to re-setup this on another VPS:

- Take Discord token from [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/418819481461063680/bot)
- Take Steam token from [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)
- docker run -d -e DISCORDTOKEN="`le discord token`" -e STEAMTOKEN="`le steam token`" --name neue simploka/neue:latest

### TODO

- Rewrite this using the latest Discord.js version *(kinda unlikely)*
- Add YouTube music stuff back *(veeeeeeeery unlikely)*
- Maybe use a real programming language (C#) next time???
